            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Kunytskyi Artur and I am a future Developer. I am a second-year IT college student. During my time at college, I have gained hands-on experience in creating software solutions that address real-world challenges and continue to learn and improve.
            I actively participate in educational projects, create my own projects, and am always open to new challenges and collaboration opportunities. My goal is to become a specialist who not only possesses technical skills but also understands users' needs.<br>
            <strong>My skills:</strong> C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Illustrator, Photoshop.</p>

        <p>The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are favorites because they offer more than just an adventure â€“ they're timeless stories of courage, friendship, and resilience. Frodo and Bilbo, as unlikely heroes, remind us that even the smallest person can make a difference, inspiring anyone facing daunting challenges.
        The breathtaking visuals and immersive storytelling transport viewers to Middle-earth, providing a perfect escape and a chance to explore themes of loyalty and hope. These films resonate deeply, offering not only stunning visuals but also lessons in bravery and perseverance that linger long after the credits roll.</p>
